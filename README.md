# Shia Pro App
The home of the Shia Pro app, built on React Native for iOS
and Android.

Shia Pro's goal is to provide all sorts of services to Shi'a
Muslims, right to their smartphones, laptops, and browsers. It provides prayer timings, Qur'an and Du'a text and recitation, nearby mosques, and step-by-step a'amaal instructions complete with tasbeeh counters, among many other features. Shia Pro is different than other solutions in its ease of use and portability. 

It is developed by me, Faizaan Datoo, in Allentown, PA. It will be available by April 2019, Insha'Allah.

## Building
Soon to come. For now, run the following commands to get the app up and running in development mode, from which you can use the "Expo" app on your phone to get it working.
```sh
npm install -g expo-cli
cd shiapro
npm start
```
